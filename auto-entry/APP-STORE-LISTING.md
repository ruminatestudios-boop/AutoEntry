## Copy you can paste

**Short description / tagline (e.g. 1 line):**  
*Add products to Shopify in seconds using your phone’s camera and AI.*

**Description (long):**  
*Auto Entry is an AI-powered product listing assistant that helps Shopify merchants add inventory quickly. Point your phone at a product barcode or packaging; the app uses computer vision and AI to extract title, description, price, and other details, then creates draft products in your store. Built for scanning in warehouses, retail, or at home—no manual data entry.*

**Key features (bullets if the listing has them):**  
- Scan products with your phone camera; no manual typing  
- AI extracts title, description, price, product type, and tags from packaging  
- Drafts created in your Shopify admin; edit and publish when ready  
- Optional image search from brand sites  
- Subscription plans with scan limits; one-time top-ups available

## Screenshots

Partners usually asks for at least one screenshot (often 1600×960 or similar). Use your dashboard, mobile scan flow, or “empty state” (e.g. `public/emptystate-files.png` if relevant). Show the main value: generating a scan, viewing drafts, or the mobile capture screen.

## After you save in Partners

- Support page in the app already uses **infoautoentry@gmail.com** and links to Privacy/Terms, so the listing and in-app experience stay consistent.
